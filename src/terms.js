<p>Thank you for being interested in UAB Pasmalves ("Company", "we", "us", "our") services. We are fully committed to the protection of your privacy at all times. This Privacy Statement explains what happens to any Personal Data (any information relating to an identifiable living person who can be directly or indirectly identified in particular by reference to an identifier) that you provide to us, or that we collect from you whilst you visit our site. Please read this information carefully in order to fully understand how we treat such Personal Data. We do update this Policy from time to time so please do review this Policy regularly.</p>

<p>When you visit our website http://www.pasmalves.lt (the "Website"), and more generally, use any of our services (the "Services", which include the Website), we appreciate that you are trusting us with your personal information. We take your privacy very seriously. In this privacy notice, we seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible what information we collect, how we use it and what rights you have in relation to it. We hope you take some time to read through it carefully, as it is important. If there are any terms in this privacy notice that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our Services immediately.</p>

<p>This privacy notice applies to all information collected through our Services (which, as described above, includes our Website), as well as, any related services, sales, marketing or events.</p>

<p>Please read this privacy notice carefully as it will help you understand what we do with the information that we collect.</p>

<p>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</p>

<p>We collect personal information that you provide to us: names, email addresses, message texts and other similar information.</p>

<p>2. HOW DO WE USE YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

<p>We use your information to contact you and provide an answer to your request and any other services requested by you.</p>

<p>3. WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</p>

<p>We will not share your information with any third parties in any circumstances other than providing services you requested or required by law.</p>

<p>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>

<p>We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</p>

<p>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>

<p>We do our best to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security.</p>

<p>6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</p>

<p>We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.</p>

<p>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>

<p>By law, you have a number of rights when it comes to your personal data. Further information and advice about your rights can be obtained from the data protection regulator in your country. These rights include:</p>

<p>You have the right to be provided with clear, transparent and easily understandable information about how we use your personal data and your rights. This is why we’re providing you with the information in this Notice.</p>

<p>You have the right to access your personal data and supplementary information. This allows you to be aware of and verify the lawfulness of the processing.</p>

<p>You are entitled to have your data corrected if it is inaccurate or incomplete.</p>

<p>The right to erasure is also known as ‘the right to be forgotten’. It enables you to request the deletion or removal of your personal data where there’s no compelling reason for us to keep processing it. This is not a general right to erasure; under certain circumstances we will need to continue processing your data in spite of a request for its deletion.</p>

<p>You have the right to request the restriction or suppression of your personal data. However, this is not an absolute right and only applies in certain circumstances. When processing is restricted, we can still store your personal data, but may not use it further.</p>

<p>This allows you to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services, for example. It allows you to move, copy or transfer personal data easily from one IT environment to another in a safe and secure way.</p>

<p>You have the right to object to processing for direct marketing (which we will only do with your consent) and also to processing which is carried out for the purposes of our legitimate interests</p>

<p>You have the right to object to any decision based solely on automated processing and you can request the chance to have a decision considered by a human so that they are able to express their point of view, or challenge the decision.</p>

<p>You have the right to lodge a complaint about the way we handle or process your personal data with your national data protection regulator.</p>

<p>If you have given your consent to anything we do with your personal data, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time (although It’s important to note that the withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal). This includes your right to withdraw consent to us using your personal data for marketing purposes.</p>

<p>We are required by law to act on requests and provide information free of charge, except where your requests are manifestly unfounded or excessive (in particular because of their repetitive nature) in which case we may charge a reasonable fee (taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or communication, or taking the action requested), or refuse to act on the request.</p>

<p>Please consider your request responsibly before submitting it. We’ll respond as soon as we can. Generally this will be within 1 month from when we receive your request but, if the request is going to take longer to deal with, we’ll come back to you and let you know within the 1 month period.</p>
